✅ What advantage does TypeScript give us?
TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing and type safety, helping developers catch errors early during development rather than at runtime.

Example:
typescript
Copy
Edit
function add(a: number, b: number): number {
  return a + b;
}

add(5, 10);     // ✅ works
add("5", "10"); // ❌ Error at compile time
🔹 Advantages:
Catches errors before execution

Better code completion & IntelliSense

Easier to maintain large codebases

Supports modern JavaScript features (ES6+)

Helps with documentation via types

✅ What does TypeScript add to JavaScript?
Static Typing – Variables can have a defined type (number, string, boolean, etc.)

Interfaces & Types – For defining object shapes

Enums – For named constants

Generics – For reusable code with type safety

Access Modifiers (public, private, protected) – For class members

Type Inference – Infers variable type from initial value

Compilation – TS compiles to browser-compatible JS

✅ Why do we need the TypeScript compiler (tsc)?
The browser cannot run .ts files. The TypeScript compiler (tsc) converts .ts into .js files which browsers understand.

🔸 What happens when you compile?
Type checking is done

Errors are reported

Type annotations are removed

.ts is transpiled to .js

✅ Types available in TypeScript:
Primitive: number, string, boolean, null, undefined

Array: string[], number[]

Tuple

Enum

Any, Unknown, Void, Never

Object

Custom types/interfaces

✅ Why does add('1', '2') show error when types are defined?
If add is defined as:

ts
Copy
Edit
function add(a: number, b: number): number {
  return a + b;
}
Calling add("1", "2") gives an error because "1" and "2" are strings, not numbers — hence type mismatch.

✅ What is type inference?
TypeScript can automatically detect the type of a variable:

ts
Copy
Edit
let age = 25; // inferred as number
🔸 Advantage:
Less code, cleaner syntax, and still type-safe.

🔸 Problem & Solution:
Sometimes inference is incorrect. You can cast it:

ts
Copy
Edit
let input = document.getElementById('username') as HTMLInputElement;
✅ What does tsc --init do?
It creates a tsconfig.json file that:

Stores compiler options

Enables features like strict mode

Lets you define target JS version (es6, etc.)

✅ What does strict mode do?
"strict": true in tsconfig.json enables all strict type-checking rules:

No implicit any

Better null checks

Safer code

✅ What does buttonElement! do? (Non-null assertion)
ts
Copy
Edit
const button = document.getElementById('myBtn')!;
This tells TypeScript:

“Trust me, this will not be null.”
Use carefully — if it's actually null, you'll get a runtime error.

✅ Why shouldn’t we use any type?
any disables type checking — defeats the purpose of TypeScript.

You lose auto-complete and safety.

Use unknown or proper types instead.

✅ How to handle objects in TypeScript?
ts
Copy
Edit
type User = {
  name: string;
  age: number;
};

const user: User = { name: "John", age: 30 };
✅ Handling Arrays:
ts
Copy
Edit
const numbers: number[] = [1, 2, 3];
✅ What does type keyword do?
ts
Copy
Edit
type Point = { x: number; y: number };
Used to define custom types for clarity and reuse.

✅ Interface vs Type:
Interface is best for objects, especially with OOP.

Interfaces can be extended, merged, and are preferred in most cases
interface User {
  name: string;
  age: number;
}
✅ How is an array a generic?
ts
Copy
Edit
Array<number> // same as number[]
Array<T> is a generic type — tells TypeScript which type will be inside.

✅ Why change target to es6?


"target": "es6"
To use features like let, const, arrow functions, etc.

ES6 is modern and widely supported.

✅ How do generics work with promises?

function fetchData(): Promise<string> {
  return new Promise((resolve) => resolve("Data loaded"));
}
Ensures the resolved value is of type string.

✅ Q1: What is Type Casting in TypeScript?
Type Casting allows you to tell the TypeScript compiler to treat a variable as a different type. This is useful when you're sure of the type, but the compiler isn’t.

Example:

ts
Copy
Edit
let value: any = "123";
let num = (value as string).length; // TypeScript now treats value as string
✅ Q2: What is the need of RequestBody and RequestParams in Express with TypeScript?
RequestBody is used to type the body of a request. Helpful in POST, PUT requests.

RequestParams is used to type URL parameters. Helpful in GET /api/user/:id type routes.

Example:

ts
Copy
Edit
import { Request, Response } from 'express';

app.post('/user', (req: Request<{}, {}, { name: string }>, res: Response) => {
  console.log(req.body.name); // Safe to access
});

🟡 Q3: What is the problem we are solving?
We want to separate TypeScript source files (.ts) from compiled JavaScript files (.js).

Also, we want a clean folder structure and automatic compilation.

🟡 Q4: How do we solve it?
We use tsconfig.json to define:

"rootDir": "./src" – where your .ts files are.

"outDir": "./dist" – where the compiled .js files go.

Now tsc will automatically compile TS to JS and place in dist.

🟡 Q5: What does outDir: './dist' do?
Tells TypeScript to place compiled JavaScript files in the dist folder.

🟡 Q6: Why change rootDir to ./src?
Keeps all TypeScript files organized in a separate folder (src) for clarity and maintainability.

🟡 Q7: Why do we add "node dist/app.js" in package.json?
So you can run the app using npm start.

  "start": "node dist/app.js",
